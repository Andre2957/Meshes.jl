    upperhull(pset)

Upper part of the convex hull of a given set of 2D points `pset`. 
The upperhull is computed according to the Andrew's Monotone Chain Algorithm.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull_algorithms.

The input is sorted on x-coordinate, and the hull is computed in two steps producing the upper and the lower parts of the hull respectively. 
This is a modification of the Graham's Scan algorithm, devised by A. M. Andrew, known as Andrew's Monotone Chain Algorithm. It has the same basic properties as Graham's scan.
